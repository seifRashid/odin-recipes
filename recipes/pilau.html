                 Heat oil in the pot. Add cumin seeds and stir until they just start to pop. Stir in onion 
                 and cook until they begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Season with garam masala, turmeric, 
                 and salt. Add vegetable broth, rice, frozen peas and carrots, and bay leaf; stir until well 
                 combined.</li>

                for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
            <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 
                10 to 40 minutes. Manually release any remaining pressure. Unlock and remove the lid. Remove bay
