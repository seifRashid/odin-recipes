        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I have been drinking te de canela, or cinnamon tea, since I was a kid. My mother always made it for us when we had a sore throat, a fever or just because. This cinnamon tea can be sweetened with honey, sugar, or piloncillo, which is Mexican brown sugar, and we often added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. As adults the tea is spiked with pure cane alcohol, which is very common amongst Hispanic people.</p>
        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 sticks Ceylon cinnamon, broken into pieces</li>
            <li>choice of sweetener, such as honey, sugar, or piloncillo (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, or as needed (optional)</li>
           
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place water and cinnamon sticks in a pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Strain tea and pour into a cup; add sweetener and lemon juice as desired.</li>
